{"id":3,"name":"(512) ONE","description":"This first anniversary release is a Belgian-style strong ale that is amber in color, with a light to medium body. Subtle malt sweetness is balanced with noticeable hop flavor, light raisin and mildly spicy, cake-like flavors, and is finished with local wildflower honey aromas. Made with 80% organic malted barley, Belgian specialty grains, Forbidden Fruit yeast, domestic hops and Round Rock local wildflower honey, this beer is deceptively high in alcohol.","abv":8.0,"created_at":"2010-12-07T02:53:38Z","updated_at":"2010-12-07T02:53:38Z","brewery":{"id":1,"name":"(512) Brewing Company"}}
