{"id":2,"name":"(512) Bruin","description":"At once cuddly and ferocious, it combines a smooth, rich maltiness and mahogany color with a solid hop backbone and stealthy 7.6% alcohol. Made with organic two-row and Munich malts, plus chocolate and crystal malts, domestic hops, and a touch of molasses, this brew has notes of raisins, dark sugars, and cocoa, and pairs perfectly with food and the crisp fall air.","abv":7.6,"created_at":"2010-12-07T02:53:38Z","updated_at":"2010-12-07T02:53:38Z","brewery":{"id":1,"name":"(512) Brewing Company"}}
