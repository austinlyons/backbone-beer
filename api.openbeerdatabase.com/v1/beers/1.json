{"id":1,"name":"(512) ALT","description":"A German-style amber ale that is fermented cooler than typical ales and cold conditioned like a lager. ALT means \"old\" in German and refers to a beer style made using ale yeast after many German brewers had switched to newly discovered lager yeast. This ale has a very smooth, yet pronounced, hop bitterness with a malty backbone and a characteristic German yeast character. Made with 98% organic two-row and Munich malts and US noble hops.","abv":6.0,"created_at":"2010-12-07T02:53:38Z","updated_at":"2010-12-07T02:53:38Z","brewery":{"id":1,"name":"(512) Brewing Company"}}
